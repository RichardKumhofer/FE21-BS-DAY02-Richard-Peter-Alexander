        <h1>The Godfather: Introduction</h1>
        <p>During a backyard wedding reception for his daughter, Connie, and his new son-in-law, Carlo Rizzi, Don Vito
            Corleone, a Mafia boss known as the Godfather, conducts business in his office. With him are his oldest son,
            Sonny, and his adopted son and family lawyer, Tom Hagen. Several people come to Vito’s office to make
            requests, including Bonasera, an undertaker seeking revenge for a crime against his daughter, and Johnny
            Fontane, a Frank Sinatra-like singer and actor who wants Vito to help land him a part in a movie. As the
            wedding reception draws to a close, Vito dispatches Tom to Los Angeles to talk to Jack Woltz, the studio
            owner. Despite Tom’s prodding, Woltz refuses to give Fontane the part, so the Corleones make Woltz “an offer
            he can’t refuse.” The day after the meeting with Tom, Woltz wakes up in a blood-stained bed to discover the
            severed head of his prized horse under the covers at his feet.</p>

            <p>Back in New York, a gangster named Sollozzo wants to involve the Corleone family in his narcotics smuggling
            operation. Two other crime families, the Barzinis and Tattaglias, are already in on the scheme, but Sollozzo
            wants Vito’s protection and financing too. Vito arranges a meeting with Sollozzo. Sonny and Tom support the
            idea of expanding the family business, but Vito cannot overcome his initial skepticism about the scheme and
            his distaste for drug trafficking. Vito rejects the offer and orders his bodyguard, Luca Brasi, to
            investigate Sollozzo. Luca is murdered, and shortly afterward a hit man attempts to assassinate Vito while
            he shops at a fruit market. Vito survives the shooting but is badly hurt, and Sonny temporarily takes
            control of the family business.</p>

            <p>Vito’s youngest son, Michael, a World War II hero, is in town for his sister’s wedding, accompanied by his
            WASP girlfriend from New England, Kay Adams. Unlike Sonny and Tom, Michael is a “civilian” who has vowed
            never to get involved in the family business. While visiting his father in the hospital, however, Michael
            discovers that the guards who were supposed to be protecting Vito have disappeared, leaving Vito vulnerable
            to another assassination attempt. Michael hides his father and pretends to be a gangster holding a gun to
            scare off the assassins. He grills a crooked cop named Captain McCluskey about whereabouts of the men who
            should be guarding Vito, and McCluskey punches him. Michael is knocked unconscious. Days later, after
            receiving advice and a gun from members of the family, Michael arranges to meet at a quiet Italian
            restaurant with Sollozzo and McCluskey to negotiate a peace. At the meeting, Michael kills both men. He then
            flees to Sicily, where Vito was born.</p>

            <p>Newspaper headlines announce the slew of Mafia killings that follow. Vito Corleone returns home from the
            hospital and is disappointed to learn that Michael has participated in a Mafia killing. While Vito recovers
            from his gunshot wounds, hot-headed Sonny and cautious Tom debate whether to escalate the war with the
            Tattaglias, Sollozzo’s sponsors.</p>

            <p>When Sonny sees Connie with a black eye, he learns that Carlo has been beating Connie, and he attacks Carlo
            brutally, hitting him with a trash can. After she suffers another beating, Connie calls Sonny, crying. He
            loses his temper and in a fit of rage drives off to beat, if not kill, Carlo. Unaccompanied by bodyguards,
            Sonny is an easy target for the Corleones’ enemies. When he stops his car at a tollbooth, the car in front
            of him stops and gunmen hiding in the tollbooth open fire. Sonny staggers out of the car, riddled with
            bullets, and falls dead.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, in picturesque Sicily, Michael falls in love at first sight with Apollonia, a young Sicilian
            beauty. He courts her, and they marry, but the marriage is cut short when Apollonia is killed by a car bomb
            intended for Michael.</p>

            <p>Back in New York, Vito assembles a meeting of the five main Mafia families. He announces that he will forgo
            vengeance for Sonny’s murder on the condition that Michael is allowed to return to New York unharmed.</p>

            <p>A year after his return, Michael visits his old flame, Kay Adams, whom he hasn’t seen in over two years. He
            tells her he works for his father now, but in the course of their discussion, he promises that the Corleone
            family will soon become legitimate. He proposes, and Kay agrees to marry him.</p>

            <p>Since Sonny is dead, Michael becomes head of the family. He begins planning to move the Corleone family to
            Las Vegas to enter the casino business. He demotes his adopted brother Tom from the position of consigliere,
            the primary advisor to the don. Vito serves as Michael’s advisor, but old age starts to take its toll on him
            and he eventually drops dead while playing with Michael’s young son, Anthony, among the tomato plants in his
            backyard.</p>

            <p>Connie and Carlo have asked Michael to be the godfather to their son. As the baptism is performed, the heads
            of the other New York Mafia families are killed by Corleone hit men on Michael’s orders. When Michael exits
            the church, he gets word that the killings have been successful. He has become the undisputed Mafia boss of
            the city.</p>

            <p>The Corleones are set to move to Las Vegas, but Michael stays behind to finish up some business. This
            business consists of taking revenge on two traitors to the family. First, he arranges for the killing of
            Tessio, his father’s old associate who has been dealing in secret with the Barzini family. Second, Michael
            kills his brother-in-law, Carlo, who tipped off the other families, allowing them to kill Sonny.</p>

            <p>A few days later, a hysterical Connie accuses Michael of killing her husband, a charge he denies to Kay with
            a forceful, if not entirely convincing, “No.” Then he retreats to his office, closing his door on his wife,
            to conduct further business.</p>
